🛠 The Idea

Paynvest is a fully on-chain platform for automated Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into ETH.
It combines two powerful protocols:
	•	Papaya Finance: to manage recurring streaming payments
	•	1inch Limit Order Protocol: to buy ETH at optimal prices

⸻

🔁 How It Works
	1.	User deposits USDC once
	2.	Sets up a DCA strategy (e.g. $10 per day)
	3.	Papaya triggers recurring on-chain transfers from the user’s balance
	4.	Each transfer is executed as a limit order via 1inch, swapping USDC → ETH
	5.	ETH accumulates in the contract and can be claimed anytime

⸻

⚙️ Key Features
	•	🔁 Recurring transfers via Papaya Finance
	•	🎯 Limit-based ETH purchases via 1inch Protocol
	•	⚙️ Configurable frequency & amount
	•	🔍 Transparent onchain execution & portfolio tracking
	•	🧑‍💻 Simple UI to create, monitor, and claim ETH
