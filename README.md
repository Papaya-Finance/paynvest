## 💡 What We’re Building

- **Name**: Paynvest  
- **Description**: Automated ETH investing through smart DCA using Papaya Finance Subscriptions and 1inch Limit Order Protocol

## 🛠 The Idea

**Paynvest** is a fully on-chain platform for automated Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into ETH.  
It combines two powerful protocols:  
- **Papaya Finance** – to manage recurring streaming payments  
- **1inch Limit Order Protocol** – to buy ETH at optimal prices

---

## 🔁 How It Works

1. User deposits USDC once  
2. Sets up a DCA strategy (e.g. $10 per day)  
3. Papaya triggers recurring on-chain transfers from the user’s balance  
4. Each transfer is executed as a limit order via 1inch, swapping USDC → ETH  
5. ETH accumulates in the contract and can be claimed anytime
